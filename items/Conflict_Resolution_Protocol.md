## Conflict Resolution Protocol:

**Rule 1:** Always communicate first.

- When disagreements surface, initiate open dialogue immediately. Ensure all parties have a chance to voice their concerns and feel understood.

**Rule 2:** Adopt a democratic approach to decisions.

- In situations requiring a group decision, implement a majority vote. Each member has a say, and the majority's choice prevails.

**Rule 3:** Address priority issues during meetings.

- Regularly identify and tackle urgent concerns or issues during group meetings to prevent escalation.

* Specifically, if a member fails to adhere to the plan or meet deadlines:
  - Rule 3a: Address the issue directly, seeking clarity on reasons for delay.
  - Rule 3b: Offer assistance if challenges are identified.

**Rule 4:** Aim for consensus.

- In the face of disagreements, work towards achieving a general consensus within the group.

* If the group struggles to find common ground:
  - Rule 4a: Seek third-party mediation, like a tutor, for guidance.
  - Rule 4b: Resorting to external help should be the last step, after all internal methods are exhausted.

**Rule 5:** Implement contingency plans for unforeseen events.

- Prepare for unexpected challenge
nges that might affect a member's capacity to participate.

* If a member becomes unwell:
  - Rule 5a: Evaluate the length and impact of their absence. Reassign tasks if they are away for an extended period or if the task is pressing.
  - Rule 5b: Upon the member's return, redistribute tasks equitably to ensure balanced workload and maintain



## The conflict happened in our group and what we did to solve it

We have faced two primary challenges. The first pertains to the design of the AVL tree. Initially, our design was influenced by the approach used in Lab4. However, upon evaluation, we recognised that this tree design didn't align with our requirements, particularly the need for each node to have both a key and a value. While Oscar advocated for retaining the original design and simply altering our data storage methodology, Yizhuo argued for a complete refactoring of the tree while preserving the data storage algorithm. In the end, we opted to redesign the tree, inspired by our innovative data storage concept.

The second challenge centers around the design of the grammar for our parser and tokenizer. Our initial concept was deemed overly simplistic. Conversely, the design from Lab6, though comprehensive, was overly intricate and thus deemed inappropriate for our needs. After careful consideration, we settled on refining our original idea, resulting in an enhanced grammar that met our criteria.
