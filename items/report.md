## Summary of Individual Contributions

Specific details of individual contribution of each member to the project.

Each team member is responsible for writing **their own subsection**.

A generic summary will not be acceptable and may result in a significant lose of marks.

*[Summarise the contributions made by each member to the project, e.g. code implementation, code design, UI design, report writing, etc.]*

*[Code Implementation. Which features did you implement? Which classes or methods was each member involved in? Provide an approximate proportion in pecentage of the contribution of each member to the whole code implementation, e.g. 30%.]*

*you should ALSO provide links to the specified classes and/or functions*
Note that the core criteria of contribution is based on `code contribution` (the technical developing of the App).

*Here is an example: (Note that you should remove the entire section (e.g. "others") if it is not applicable)*

 **UID1, Name1**  I have 30% contribution, as follows: <br>
  - **Code Contribution in the final App**
    - Feature A1, A2, A3 - class Dummy: [Dummy.java](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/comp2100/group-project/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/items/media/_examples/Dummy.java)
    - XYZ Design Pattern -  class AnotherClass: [functionOne()](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/comp2100/group-project/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/items/media/_examples/Dummy.java#L22-43), [function2()](the-URL)
    - ... (any other contribution in the code, including UI and data files) ... [Student class](../src/path/to/class/Student.java), ..., etc.*, [LanguageTranslator class](../src/path/to/class/LanguageTranslator.java): function1(), function2(), ... <br><br>

  - **Code and App Design** 
    - [What design patterns, data structures, did the involved member propose?]*
    - [UI Design. Specify what design did the involved member propose? What tools were used for the design?]* <br><br>

  - **Others**: (only if significant and significantly different from an "average contribution") 
    - [Report Writing?] [Slides preparation?]*
    - [You are welcome to provide anything that you consider as a contribution to the project or team.] e.g., APK, setups, firebase* <br><br>

## Application Description

Aussic is an app designed specifically for Australian music lovers. This not only satisfies the search function, it is also a music discovery platform that focuses on showing the unique charm of Australian singers.

1. **Smart Music Search**: Users can easily enter song titles, artists or related keywords, and Aussic will display a rich Australian music playlist.

2. **Listening and exploration**: Each Australian song is equipped with a 30-second demo, allowing users to quickly understand the tone and style of the song. Once you like it, click on the external link to hear the full version.

3. **Interaction and Favorites**: In Aussic, users can like their favorite songs or add them to favorites, while our daily recommendations feature will provide our users with more ideas.

Whether a person is a loyal fan of Australian music or is just beginning to explore this music world, Aussic will open a door to Australian music and allow Aussic users to experience the unique music style.

### Application Use Cases and or Examples

**1. Application use case: music search**

User Niu wants to find a song by Australian singer Troye Sivan:

1. Niu open the Aussic app and log in to your account.
2. In the search bar, she types "Troye Sivan."
3. The application displays a list of songs by Troye Sivan.
4. Niu selected the song she wanted to listen to and clicked on the 30-second preview.

**2. Application use case: Add to favorites**

User Jake heard a song by the Australian band Tame Impala that he liked very much, and he wanted to save the song:

1. Jake clicks the "Add to Favorites" button on the song playback interface.
2. The song was successfully added to his collection list.
3. Jake can listen to the song again in "My Collection" at any time.


**3. Application use case: daily music recommendation**

User Ley likes to listen to some new songs every morning to start his day:

1. Alex opens the Aussic app every day.
2. On the home page, he will see the "Aussic Daily Recommendations" section.
3. Alex clicks play and starts listening to the recommended Australian music.



*List all the use cases in text descriptions or create use case diagrams. Please refer to https://www.visual-paradigm.com/guide/uml-unified-modeling-language/what-is-use-case-diagram/ for use case diagram.*

## Code Design and Decisions

This is an important section of your report and should include all technical decisions made. Well-written justifications will increase your marks for both the report as well as for the relevant parts (e.g., data structure). This includes, for example,

- Details about the parser (describe the formal grammar and language used)

- Decisions made (e.g., explain why you chose one or another data structure, why you used a specific data model, etc.)

- Details about the design patterns used (where in the code, justification of the choice, etc)

*Please give clear and concise descriptions for each subsections of this part. It would be better to list all the concrete items for each subsection and give no more than `5` concise, crucial reasons of your design.

<hr>

### Data Structures

*[What data structures did your team utilise? Where and why?]*

Here is a partial (short) example for the subsection `Data Structures`:*

*I used the following data structures in my project:*

1. *LinkedList*

   * *Code Locations: defined in [Class X, methods Z, Y](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/comp2100/group-project/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/items/media/_examples/Dummy.java#L22-43) and [class AnotherClass, lines l1-l2](url); processed using [dataStructureHandlerMethod](url) and ...
   * *Reasons:*
      * *It is more efficient than Arraylist for insertion with a time complexity O(1)*
      * *We don't need to access the item by index for xxx feature because...*
      * For the (part), the data ... (characteristics) ...

(If you choose to make this an external document, link to it here)]*

This shall include an agreed procedure for situations including (but not limited to):
- e.g., if a member fails to meet the initial plan and/or deadlines
- e.g., if your group has issues, how will your group reach consensus or solve the problem?
- e.g., if a member gets sick, what is the solution? Alternatively, what is your plan to mitigate the impact of unforeseen incidents for this 6-to-8-week project?
